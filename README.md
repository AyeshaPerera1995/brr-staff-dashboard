### üåê Technologies Used
- Next.js       App Router, Server/Client components
- React	        Hooks, functional components
- TypeScript	Strong typing throughout
- Tailwind CSS	CSS styling
- React Icons	Icons across cards and status indicators

- Jest + RTL    Basic unit testing

### üß† Assumptions Made
- User authentication is mocked with a hardcoded user in Context (Ayesha, role: Admin)
- All data (staff, tickets, tasks) is static ‚Äî no backend or real API used
- File upload is simulated and not stored/sent
- No validation libraries were used
- Project assumes modern browsers with JavaScript enabled

### üß© What I‚Äôd Add With More Time
If more time was available, I would enhance the app with:

- Full authentication with role-based access (Admin/User)
- Backend API with database
- Persistent storage (e.g., localStorage, MongoDB)
- Dashboard analytics (charts for tickets/tasks)
- Toast notifications
- Due dates or calendar integration in the to-do list
- Full unit test coverage with mocks
- User avatars and profile settings
